# esri-redux
> Simple boilerplate demonstrating how to setup a project using React, Redux, and the Esri JavaScript API. Demo available at [https://robert-w.github.io/esri-redux/](https://robert-w.github.io/esri-redux/)

### Getting started
This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start` or `npm secure`
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` or `https://localhost:3000`

`npm install` will install most dependencies and on `postinstall`, bower will install the rest.  This project has browser sync setup with live reload, so it will refresh as you develop.

### NPM scripts
`npm start`
> Starts the babel-cli, watches your html and sass files for changes, and starts browser-sync with live reload.  Generated/copied files will end up in the build directory which is where browser-sync serves from.

`npm test`
> Tests all src files with eslint.

`npm run dist`
> Generates an optimized build in the `dist` directory. It uses gulp-sass for sass files, gulp-replace to inject critical.css into the html, and rollup to transpile ES6 modules to AMD before RequireJS optimizer comes in to minify and bundle in built libraries. For more info, see [Building - Rollup & RequireJS](building-rollup-requirejs).

`npm run secure`
> Same as `npm start` but uses HTTPS instead of HTTP. See [HTTPS](#HTTPS).

### Tooling

#### CSS Preprocessing - Sass
This uses gulp-sass at the moment for portability, but it may be switched for the official sass Ruby gem at some point if it becomes necessary, for now this works.

#### ES6 - Babel
This uses Babel for transpiling the build, it also uses `React`, `es2015`, and `stage-0` presets so I can play with the latest ES6 features. It compiles to AMD via babel plugins in develop and rollup in production builds so that there is no issue at runtime.

#### Building - Rollup & RequireJS
Rollup seems more efficient for ES6 modules than babel as it will bundle them and eliminate duplicate polyfills or babel helpers, such as classCallCheck or createClass.  However it does not work well when trying to bundle in built UMD modules, or atleast I have not figured out the configuration for that yet, so I use requirejs optimizer to come in after rollup and combine the bundled js file with React and Redux.  If you choose to load those libraries from a CDN, which is a good idea, you can omit requirejs and use rollup with an uglifier to minify the bundle after rollup creates it.  This would make the bundle much lighter since it would not need React and Redux included.  I am still looking for a easier solution for an all-inclusive bundle with rollup so this may change if I figure it out or if rollup support seems to fade.

### Performance considerations
1. Prerender with [react-prerender](https://github.com/Robert-W/react-prerender).  This will prerender your react component and inject it into your html.  This will give the appearance that your components have already rendered when the page loads without having to wait for the JSAPI, React, or your own modules to load.  Once react loads, it will mount to it and start from there.
2. Async assets when possible.  The ArcGIS Javascript API is loaded with an async tag.  It also will defer loading `app.css` and Esri's CSS until after the above the fold content loads, this is so that those assets don't block the loading of the main `index.html` file.
3. Inject `critical.css` into `index.html` so that above the fold content does not need another trip to the server to render properly, thus avoiding that annoying flash of un-styled content that some pages have.

### Security
This has the ability to run in HTTPS since it uses protocol agnostic resources. It also has a Content Security Policy with the following configurations for local resources and `js.arcgis.com` resources, which can be tweaked or removed from the app by modifying it in the head section of `src/index.html`.

```
script-src 'self' js.arcgis.com 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';
style-src 'self' js.arcgis.com 'unsafe-inline';
```

### HTTPS
If you run `npm secure` it will load a browser sync server using https but it will show up in your browser as untrusted since there is no certificate setup, it's just there so you can test that the code works and is not meant to be a fully configured https web server.
